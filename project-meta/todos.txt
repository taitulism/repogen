* inline TODOs
* it looks like .vscode is ignored by the tpl/.gitignore file
* choose license
* separate to small files
* remove travis from flow (keep somewhere). not actually TDDing from the start...
* consider local repo exists (.git file)
* eslint config (my preset)
* next phase readme template (install, usage, contribute, changelog?, footer - thanks, bugs)
